Fixed the alphabetical sort issue with --output-to-lower. The sort_columns_alphabetically function now respects output-to-lower and output-to-upper settings. Columns are sorted based on their final case, ensuring correct alphabetical order in the output YAML. Added 3 test cases to verify the fix. Commit: b8e6960
