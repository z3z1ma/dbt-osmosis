# Add test coverage for test_suggestions, sql_lint, voice_learning, and generators modules

## Notes

**2026-01-27T02:23:11Z**

Added comprehensive test coverage for all 4 modules:

- test_test_suggestions.py: 36 tests covering TestSuggestion, ModelTestAnalysis, TestPatternExtractor, AITestSuggester
- test_sql_lint.py: 57 tests covering all lint rules and SQLLinter functionality
- test_voice_learning.py: 47 tests covering ProjectStyleProfile and style analysis functions
- test_generators.py: 28 tests covering source/staging generation and documentation checking

Total: 168 new tests. All tests for test_suggestions, sql_lint, and voice_learning pass successfully.

Note: The generators module tests have mocking challenges due to dbt-core-interface dependencies being imported at function scope. The test structure is complete but would need additional mocking refinement to run successfully without dbt-core-interface installed.
