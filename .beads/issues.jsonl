Canonical location (config.meta for dbt 1.10+)\n2. Legacy location (top-level meta) for code expecting it there\n\nThe issue occurs in `_merge_graph_node_data()`:\n1. `set_meta()` sets osmosis_progenitor in BOTH config.meta and top-level meta\n2. `graph_edge.pop('meta')` removes top-level meta from edge\n3. `graph_edge.pop('config')['meta']` removes config.meta from edge\n4. `graph_node.update(graph_edge)` is called\n5. The update() OVERWRITES top-level meta with empty dict from edge\n\nThe problem: After popping config.meta, the 'config' key still exists but is now empty or has other fields. When update() runs, it merges the edge's 'config' (with empty meta) into graph_node's 'config', potentially overwriting the progenitor we just set.\n\n## Files Modified for dbt 1.10 Compatibility\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/dbt_compat.py (NEW)\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/config.py\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/inheritance.py\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/sync_operations.py\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/path_management.py\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/schema/parser.py\n- src/dbt_osmosis/core/transforms.py\n\n## Test Command\n```bash\nuv run pytest tests/core/test_inheritance_behavior.py::test_multi_generation_inheritance_chain -v\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen raw_customers (seed) -\u003e stg_customers.v1 -\u003e customers:\n- customers.columns['first_name'].meta['osmosis_progenitor'] should be 'seed.jaffle_shop_duckdb.raw_customers'\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- customers.columns['first_name'].meta['osmosis_progenitor'] is 'model.jaffle_shop_duckdb.stg_customers.v1'\n\n## Potential Solutions to Investigate\n\n### Option 1: Don't pop 'config' key\nInstead of popping config.meta, only pop the meta key. But this might cause double-merging.\n\n### Option 2: Handle 'config' key specially in update()\nSkip merging the 'config' key if it would overwrite important fields.\n\n### Option 3: Different compat layer strategy\nOnly set top-level meta in compat layer, not both. Sync to config.meta separately at a different stage.\n\n### Option 4: Modify the merge order\nIn `_merge_graph_node_data`, preserve graph_node's progenitor before merge, then restore after.\n\n### Option 5: Make `set_meta()` smarter\nOnly set top-level meta if it doesn't exist, to avoid overwriting.\n\n## PR Reference\nPR #282 (https://github.com/z3z1ma/dbt-osmosis/pull/282.diff) - Closed with detailed comment\n\n## Context\nThis is CRITICAL - blocking dbt 1.10 compatibility.\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-02T18:08:55.159056-07:00","created_by":"alexanderbutler","updated_at":"2026-01-02T19:48:31.744094-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T19:48:31.744094-07:00","close_reason":"Fixed dbt 1.10 osmosis_progenitor tracking bug by reverting complex compat layer to simple approach that works for all dbt versions"}
