# How-to guides

How-to guides are **goal-oriented**: they assume you know the basics and want to accomplish a specific task.

## Common tasks

- [Run dbt-osmosis on-demand, in pre-commit, or CI](../tutorial-yaml/workflow)
- [Select a subset of nodes to process](../tutorial-yaml/selection)
- [Manage source YAML files](./manage-sources)
- [Review changes safely before applying](./review-changes)
- [Generate missing documentation with `--synthesize`](../tutorial-yaml/synthesize)
- [Migrate to dbt-osmosis 1.x](../migrating)
