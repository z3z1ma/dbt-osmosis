# Tutorials

Tutorials are **learning-oriented**: follow a linear path and finish with a working outcome.

## Start here

- [Intro](../intro)
- [Installation](../tutorial-basics/installation)
- [Your first refactor](./first-refactor)

## What you will accomplish

- Install `dbt-osmosis` (via `uv` or `pip`)
- Configure a basic `+dbt-osmosis` routing rule
- Run `dbt-osmosis yaml refactor` safely with `--dry-run` and `--check`
- Apply and review generated YAML updates
