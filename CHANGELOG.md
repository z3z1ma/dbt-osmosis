## 0.11.23 - 2023-08-11

## 0.11.16 - 2023-03-31
### Fixed
* Ensure we use regular jinja parsing and NOT experimental parsing or rust parsing because both of these involve randomized correctness tests sampled from user projects in the wild if not explicitly disable and both seem to want to pickle an object with an RLock, probably an adapter instance
